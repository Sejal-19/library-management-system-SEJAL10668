## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Frontend (Thymeleaf):** Displays pages and forms for user interaction.  
2. **Backend (Spring Boot):** Handles data processing and business logic.  
3. **Database (MySQL):** Stores details about books and users.  
4. **MVC Design:** Separates data (Model), UI (View), and logic (Controller).
